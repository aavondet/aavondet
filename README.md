### Hi there, I'm Arnaud 👋

I'm an undergrad studying Math and CS at Carnegie Mellon University. In class I love writing mathematical proofs, in my free time I am a web developer who enjoys designing and writing frontend code. I also have been following the blockchain industry closely for the past two years and am excited for the web3.0 revolution! 

🌱 Currently learning React
